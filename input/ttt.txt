Requiem,

In the end, only the dead shall remain;
One man, one soul, one will to Defile;
A single guide that can stop this Wall of Pain;
An alone soul from the Shadow Isle.

Free me from the pleasures of this flesh Cocoon;
Guide our feeble souls with your beautiful voice;
Lay Waste upon thy enemies on this beautiful moon;
Following your song in this rhythmic rejoice.

I ask for forgiveness for all my sins;
I ask for a guide to bring me salvation;
I ask for thyself when your pilgramage begins;
I ask for thyself out of desperation.

I ask for a single wish in my postmortem;
I ask for thyself; please bring forth Requiem.
